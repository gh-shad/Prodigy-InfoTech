\# Caesar Cipher Program 🛡️🔐



A simple Python implementation of the \*\*Caesar Cipher\*\* encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a basic cryptographic technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

\## 📜 Features



\- Encrypt plain text messages using a user-defined shift value

\- Decrypt encrypted messages back to plain text

\- Handles both uppercase and lowercase characters

\- Preserves non-alphabetical characters (punctuation, numbers, etc.)

\## 🧠 How It Works



\- The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each alphabetical character in the message by a specific number (`shift`).

\- Characters wrap around the alphabet (e.g., shifting `'z'` by 1 becomes `'a'`).

\- Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.
