\# 🖼️ Simple Image Encryption Tool



A basic Python script that performs \*\*image encryption and decryption\*\* using \*\*color inversion\*\*. This technique flips the RGB values of every pixel to produce a visually encrypted image, which can be decrypted by inverting the image again.

\## 🔐 How It Works



The encryption and decryption technique used in this tool is \*\*color inversion\*\*:

\- For every pixel `(R, G, B)` in the image:

&nbsp; - Replace it with `(255 - R, 255 - G, 255 - B)`

\- Reapplying this process on the encrypted image restores the original image.

\## 🧰 Features



\- Encrypts images by inverting pixel colors

\- Decrypts images using the same technique

\- Supports JPG and PNG image formats

\- Simple command-line interface
